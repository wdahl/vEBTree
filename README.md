# vEBTree
Java implementation of van Emde Boas tree

## Run
The code cnbe run in the terminal by running the follwoing commands:
```bash
javac *.java
java vEBTreeDriver
```

## Output
The output of the code should be a plot with the times for both the insertions and successors calls over
the samples.

## Dependencies
To plot the graph in java I used the PtPlot module. PtPlot is free, supported by the University of
California, written in Java (and thus runs under Unix, Linux, Macâ€™s and MS Windows), and is easy to
use for 2-D data plotting or histograms
